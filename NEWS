#### User-visible changes

- CreateInputsModel() now returns an error if NLayers <= 0 when CemaNeige is used.

##################### 1.0.2 Release Notes (2016-11-03) #####################


#### New features

- SeriesAggreg() gains a TimeLag argument that corresponds to a numeric value indicating a time lag (in seconds) for the time series aggregation (useful to aggregate hourly time series to the daily time step for instance).
 In addition, the function now accepts input dates in both POSIXt formats (POSIXct and POSIXlt). The output is in POSIXct format.
 
- plot_OutputsModel() gains a log_scale argument in order to plot the flow with a log scale.

- A tutorial is available online on the following link: from http://webgr.irstea.fr/airGR.
 It can also be displayed with the vignette("airGR") command.
 

#### Bug fixes

- The value sort for the transfo argument of CreateInputsCrit() was not taken into account. It is now fixed. 


#### Deprecated and defunct

- CreateCalibOptions() loses the OptimParam argument that was redundant with the FixedParam argument. The Calibration_Michel() was modified to take into account this change by using directly FixedParam, but this is transparent to the user. 

- CreateCalibOptions() loses the StartParam argument that was not used. 

 
#### Major user-visible changes

- The RunModel_GR6J() and RunModel_CemaNeigeGR6J() models were modified back to versions previous to 1.0.1 to prevent from unwanted efficiency criteria deterioration related to the calibration with Calibration_Michel(). 
 The actual model codes were not modified but the TransfoParam_GR6J() and CreateCalibOptions() functions were modified regarding the X5 parameter. 
 It is strongly advised to use airGR 1.0.2 for the RunModel_GR6J() and RunModel_CemaNeigeGR6J() functions if you are using Calibration_Michel(), as they are much more efficient. 
 In case you were using your own calibration algorithm, you will not notice any difference. 


#### Minor user-visible changes

- CreateInputsModel() and DataAltiExtrapolation_Valery() functions now allow both POSIXt formats (POSIXct and POSIXlt).





##################### 1.0.1 Release Notes (2016-04-21) #####################

#### Deprecated and defunct

- The Calibration_HBAN() and DataAltiExtrapolation_HBAN() functions have respectively been renamed as Calibration_Michel() and DataAltiExtrapolation_Valery() after the names of their creators.

- The Calibration_optim() function has been removed from the package.

- The silent mode is now defined by the verbose = TRUE argument (formerly quiet = FALSE) in the following functions:
Calibration(), Calibration_Michel(), CreateInputsModel(), CreateRunOptions(), DataAltiExtrapolation_Valery(), ErrorCrit(), ErrorCrit_KGE(), ErrorCrit_KGE2(), ErrorCrit_NSE(), ErrorCrit_RMSE(), plot_OutputsModel(), SeriesAggreg().


#### Major user-visible changes
- The GR5J model has been modified: previously, two unit hydrographs were used, now only one is remaining.
 As a consequence, simulations from the GR5J (RunModel_GR5J() function) and CemaNeige (RunModel_CemaNeigeGR5J() function) models will be different.

- An important proportion of the transformations of the parameters have been modified (TransfoParam_*() functions). Since this modifies the local search, calibration results will be different .

- The quantiles of the parameters have been recalculated with the new transformations (CreateCalibOptions() function). Since these quantiles constitute the starting point of the calibration algorithm, calibration results will be different.


#### Minor user-visible changes

- The Fortran model core codes have been modified:
	- optimisation of the codes for fastening of computation;
	- simplification of the internal variables for easier reading and understanding.
	
- The list of the contributors and authors is now full.

- The references of the package has been updated; they are returned by the following R-command citation("airGR").

#### Major user-visible changes

- Update of the functions CreateRunOptions(), CreateCalibOptions() and plot_OutputsModel() to handle the new models.

- Modification of CemaNeige Fortran code to add an update of Gratio after the SnowPack update (no impact on snow simulation).

#### Major user-visible changes

- CemaNeige users must now specify one MeanAnSolidPrecip for each elevation layer. The CreateRunOptions() function is impacted.

- CemaNeige users can now specify the mean elevation of the input series (before it was always considered equal to the catchment median elevation). 
 The impacted functions are CreateInputsModel() and DataAltiExtrapolation_HBAN().
 
- New architecture with better format verification procedure (using classes) and simpler setting of default configuration.

- New architecture where the model, calibration and error functions are in the arguments of the functions
 (the exotic use of "generic function" created by the users has been removed).

##################### 0.6.2 Release Notes (2014-02-12) #####################


#### New features

- Additional functions for results plotting (the {zoo} package is required for some of them).

- Add multi-objective calibration using nsga2() (the {mco} package is required).

- The field Multiplier has been added in the ErrorCrit() outputs, to indicate whether the criterion is an error (to minimise) or and efficiency (to maximise).
 This allows to provide real efficiency values in the outputs e.g. NSE[Q] instead of (-1) &times; NSE[Q].


#### Bug fixes

- RC11 bug correction: the automatic selection of the warm-up period was not working properly when no data was available from warm-up (i.e. when the user had set the run to start at the very first index).

- RC10 bug correction: the CalibrationAlgo_HBAN() function was not working in the very rare case when the diagonal search was activated and lead to a set outside the authorised range.

- RC9 bug correction: the CalibrationAlgo_HBAN() function was not working properly with models having only one parameter.

- RC8 bug correction of the ModelDefaultIniOptions() function (this bug was introduced in the RC7 and caused an error when IndPeriod_WarmUp = NULL.

- RC7 bug correction of the ModelDefaultIniOptions() function (the automatic selection of one year for warm-up was not handling properly missing data).

- RC6 correction of the help files (the description of CemaNeige parameters were inverted).

- RC5 differs from previous releases in the way the data are read and stored (in a list instead of individual vectors).
 The package is similar, only the examples of Main and the files in MyScriptBlocks have changed.
 All basin data are now stored inside a list named BasinData. This will greatly ease the future use of Rdata files (instead of txt files) as storage format for the time series of observation. 


#### Deprecated and defunct

- EfficiencyCrit() have been replaced by ErrorCrit() to avoid misunderstanding (by default, the algorithms minimise the error criterion).


#### Major user-visible changes

- The definition of the generic function is now made in a much simpler way (e.g. see DefineFunctions_Model() or DefineFunctions_ErrorCrit()).


#### Minor user-visible changes
